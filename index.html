                    <b> Explanation: </b>

                    Making landfall in Oregon, the
                    <a href="http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/gallery.asp?Gallery=Eclipses">Moon's
                    dark umbral shadow</a> toured the United States on August 21.

                    Those gathered along its coast to coast path were
                    <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deepskycolors/36672924221/">witness
                    to a total eclipse</a> of the Sun, possibly the most
                    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/eclipselive">widely shared celestial
                    event</a> in history.

                    But first, the Moon's shadow touched the northern Pacific and
                    raced eastward toward land.

                    This dramatic snapshot was
                    <a href="http://www.twanight.org/newTWAN/photos.asp?ID=3005739">taken
                    while crossing the shadow path</a> 250 miles off the Oregon
                    coast, 45,000 feet above the cloudy northern Pacific.

                    Though from a shorter totality, it captures the eclipse
                    before it could be seen from the US mainland.

                    With the eclipsed Sun not far above, beautiful colors appear along the
                    western horizon giving way to a clear, pitch-black, stratospheric sky
                    in the shadow of the Moon.
